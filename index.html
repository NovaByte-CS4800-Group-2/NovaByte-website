        Wildfire response application to provide various levels of support for
        victims of wildfires. Through an interactive, chat-like interface, users
        will be able to communicate with individuals, companies, and small
        businesses willing to provide aid. Rather than having to search for
        assistance through different platforms, websites, and applications, our
        application provides a consolidated database that supports victims at a
        vulnerable time of need.
